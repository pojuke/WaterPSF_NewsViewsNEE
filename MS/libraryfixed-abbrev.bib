abstract = {There is considerable debate about whether community ecology will ever produce general principles. We suggest here that this can be achieved but that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species interactions independent of the environment. We assert that community ecology should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized niche in the context of a biotic interaction milieu. We suggest this approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more readily address issues of global change.},

abstract = {For species in disturbance-prone ecosystems, vital rates (survival, growth and reproduction) often vary both between and within phases of the cycle of disturbance and recovery; some of this variation is imposed by the environment, but some may represent adaptation of the life history to disturbance. Anthropogenic changes may amplify or impede these patterns of variation, and may have positive or negative effects on population growth. Using stochastic population projection matrix models, we develop stochastic elasticities (proportional derivatives of the long-run population growth rate) to gauge the population effects of three types of change in demographic variability (changes in within- and between-disturbance-phase variability and phase-specific changes). Computing these elasticities for five species of disturbance-influenced perennial plants, we pinpoint demographic rates that may reveal adaptation to disturbance, and we demonstrate that species may differ in their responses to different types of changes in demographic variability driven by climate change.},

abstract = {To determine to roles of prior evolutionary divergence and competitive displacement of species in successional community organization, and aspects of the colonizing strategy, 6 co—occuring annuals were grown together and alone on a soil moisture gradient. The species had similar board vegetative and reproductive responses to the gradient. Interspecific competition reduced the niche breadth and similarities of the species. Competitive and gradient stresses were generally absorbed through plasticity, although Polygonum pensylvanicum and Chenopodium album showed some mortality. Response centers of Polygonum, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, and Chenopodium, competitively subordinate species, shifted due to interspecific competition. Amaranthus retroflexus and Setaria faberii, the leading competitors, already slightly offset from each other when grown alone, did not shift response centers. Competition delayed the start of flowering in Setaria, Chenopodium, Polygonum and Ambrosia. Competitive success did not correlate...},

Being based on any suitable (not necessarily symmetric) plot-to-plot dissimilarity coefficient the test is appropriate for analyzing multivariate data that are usually zero-inflated due to the large number of rare species and for which the number of variables (species) is typically larger than the number of observations (plots). To illustrate the proposed test in practice, we used data from two beech forests with different management history in Abruzzo (central Italy).},
